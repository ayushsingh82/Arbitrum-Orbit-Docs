# Problem Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA Aims to Solve

Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA is designed to address critical challenges in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly regarding scalability, cost-effectiveness, and data availability. Here are the main problems it aims to solve:

## Scalability Limitations
Traditional blockchains face significant scalability challenges due to limited throughput, leading to congestion and delayed transactions. Arbitrum Orbit leverages Avail as a dedicated data availability layer, enabling the system to scale effectively while maintaining performance and transaction speed.

## High Transaction Costs
Deploying applications directly on Layer 1 networks can incur high gas fees, particularly during peak times. By utilizing Avail, Arbitrum Orbit can significantly reduce the on-chain storage requirements and associated costs, making it more accessible for developers and users.

## Data Availability Assurance
Ensuring that transaction data is available and verifiable is crucial for decentralized applications. The integration of Avail as a dedicated DA layer provides robust data availability, reducing the risk of data unavailability that could compromise application integrity.

## Enhanced User Experience
By minimizing costs and ensuring faster transactions, Arbitrum Orbit with Avail aims to provide a smoother and more efficient user experience, encouraging broader adoption of blockchain technologies.

# Challenges Faced During Deployment

During the deployment of Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA, several specific challenges were encountered, particularly related to transaction failures:

## Transaction Call Exceptions
The deployment process encountered a "CALL_EXCEPTION" error, which indicates that the transaction could not be completed successfully. This issue often arises from incorrect contract addresses, insufficient gas limits, or misconfigured parameters within the transaction data.

## Gas Limit Misconfiguration
The specified gas limit for the transaction might have been too low for the operations being performed, leading to transaction failure. Adjusting the gas limit to accommodate the complexity of the operations is critical to successful deployment.

## Parameter Mismatch
The deployment error log suggests potential mismatches in the input parameters for the smart contract function being called. Ensuring that the parameters align with the expected inputs of the smart contract is crucial for successful execution.

## Testing Environment Compatibility
When deploying on test networks like Sepolia, compatibility issues between contract versions and test network configurations can lead to failures. Ensuring all dependencies and configurations are correctly set up is essential for smooth deployment.

## Docker Resource Limitations
Running the Avail setup through Docker requires substantial system resources. Insufficient memory or CPU resources can lead to performance issues or deployment failures, necessitating optimization of the development environment.

## Debugging and Error Handling
Debugging the transaction failure requires careful examination of transaction data and the associated smart contract logic. Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms can assist in identifying and rectifying issues promptly.

## Security and Key Management
Managing sensitive data, such as private keys and configuration parameters, is crucial during deployment. Ensuring robust security measures to protect this information while maintaining functionality is a constant challenge.

In summary, while the deployment of Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA is aimed at solving significant blockchain issues, the process presents unique challenges, particularly around transaction management and environment configuration. Addressing these challenges effectively is key to achieving successful deployment and operation of the system.
